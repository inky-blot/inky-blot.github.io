<p>Mesh assets are the geometric information about a 3D object. Any 3D object visible in-game will require a mesh.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-mesh">Types of Mesh</h2>
<p>There are two types of mesh.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Static meshes</strong> don&rsquo;t bend or deform naturally, so you have limited options to animate them. These are the meshes you use for environments and such.</li>
<li><strong>Skeletal meshes</strong> have bones and a skeleton, meaning somebody took the time to make sure the model could bend and twist and all that. These are what are used for characters, usually.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    For this project, you are encouraged to use <strong>skeletal meshes</strong> for your weapons and characters whenever possible.
</blockquote><p>The skeleton your character uses is very important, as it determines which animations work with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, this project uses <strong>X Bot</strong>, which is Mixamo&rsquo;s standard. It is compatible with most or all animations available on Mixamo. You can swap the model freely with any model on Mixamo.</li>
<li>Included in the project is also <strong>Manny</strong>, which is Unreal&rsquo;s standard. It should be compatible with a lot of the animations available on Fab (the Unreal asset store). You can swap the model freely with some of the models on Fab or online.</li>
</ul>
<p>One quirk of Unreal is that mesh blueprints must be either skeletal or static.<br>
By default, the template weapon blueprint is <strong>based on skeletal meshes</strong>.<br>
We can convert a static mesh to a skeletal mesh when <strong>importing the FBX.</strong></p>
<h3 id="sts-converting-static-to-skeletal">STS: Converting static to skeletal</h3>
<p>First, hit the &ldquo;Import&rdquo; button. Find the FBX for your weapon (it is likely in your downloads folder, if you got it online).<br>
<img src="/ob/Images/Skeletons/Tutorial_Skeletons_1.png" alt="">In the subsequent modal, you need to <strong>check &ldquo;Skeletal Mesh.&rdquo;</strong> This tells Unreal to convert it. If you do not give it a skeleton, Unreal will make a very simple one for it. Make sure you rename your new assets.<br>
<img src="/ob/Images/Skeletons/Tutorial_Skeletons_2.png" alt=""><br>
In your weapon&rsquo;s blueprint, find <strong>Mesh in in the Class Defaults menu</strong>. Set it to the skeletal mesh you just created.<br>
<img src="/ob/Images/Skeletons/Tutorial_Skeletons_3.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="sockets">Sockets</h2>
<p><strong>Sockets</strong> are a named &ldquo;snap point&rdquo; added to a skeleton. Using sockets, a weapon can be held or otherwise bound to different parts of the mesh.</p>
<h3 id="sts-creating-a-socket">STS: Creating a socket</h3>
<p>Open the skeleton asset. We need to <strong>find a bone near</strong> where we want to hold the item. I&rsquo;m going to use the <code>RightHand</code> bone.<br>
<img src="/ob/Images/Skeletons/Tutorial_Skeletons_4.png" alt=""><br>
Right-click the bone and <strong>add a socket</strong>.<br>
<img src="/ob/Images/Skeletons/Tutorial_Skeletons_5.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Change the name</strong> of the socket. Name it something easy to remember and copy! Try not to change this name later.<br>
<img src="/ob/Images/Skeletons/Tutorial_Skeletons_6.png" alt=""><br>
Jump back to your character blueprint (by default, <code>BP_FirstPerson</code>). On your weapon component, <strong>find the socket field</strong> in your details panel. Click the folder with a magnifying class icon, then choose the correct socket.<br>
<img src="/ob/Images/Skeletons/Tutorial_Skeletons_7.png" alt="">Finally, we can adjust the positioning. <strong>You can either move the socket directly in the skeleton menu</strong> (tricky to do because you can&rsquo;t preview the output, but super clean and reusable) or <strong>add local transforms to your weapon component</strong> (messier but easier to preview).</p>
